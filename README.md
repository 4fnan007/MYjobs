# MYjobs
# Overview
MyJobs is a user-friendly web application designed to bring together services and workers seamlessly. Services register using their email and password, providing essential details such as their name, phone number, and other details. Upon registration and verification, services can create job posts detailing specific work requirements. These posts are then made available to workers. Individuals can browse through the latest job posts and apply for those that interest them by providing their name, contact information, location, and resume or other necessary documents. Once an individual applies, the service reviews the information and decides whether to approve or reject the applicant for the specific job. This platform simplifies the process of finding jobs and workers, ultimately enhancing the job sector.
